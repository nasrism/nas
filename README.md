Hi there!

Welcome to my portfolio 🎊

This is my first step to be a front-end developer. 👨‍💻

This is created in 20/9/2023

and a 20th day of me learning about front-end developer (yup newbies here)

The reason I want to be a front-end developer:
1) I love coding since highschool.
2) I love challenge myself.
3) I love staying at home.
4) I want to work from home.

Yup! that's all for now! 

Hope you enjoy my portfolio and keep in touch with me
